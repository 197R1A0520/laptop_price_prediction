# **laptop_price_prediction**
**Problem statement :**

Perform regression analysis to predict the price of a laptop based on its components by taking all the input parameters Also plot visuals by using Matplotlib/Seaborn data visualization comparing the different features of the input parameters and do Exploratory data analysis (EDA) by using pandas. 

**IMPORTED LIBRARIES:** 

I have imported the libraries are pandas , numpy ,matplotlib ,seaborn. 

**OBJECTIVES:**

By using regression analysis to predict the price of a laptop based on its components by taking all the input parameters.



**CONCLUSION:**

By using LinearRegression I have got 100% accuracy and I have done lot of EDA and finally I
got 100% accuracy and I have done DATA VISUALISATION also.
